# Design System Extractor Chrome Extension

## Overview

Design System Extractor is a Chrome extension that allows you to extract and save design systems from any website. It helps developers and designers quickly capture:

- Colors (excluding grayscale colors)
- Fonts
- Button Styles

The extension displays the extracted elements in an easy-to-use popup and provides functionality to copy color codes, font families, and button CSS styles to your clipboard.

## Features

- **Extract Colors**: Retrieves all unique colors used on a webpage, excluding grayscale colors. Clicking on a color code copies it to your clipboard.
- **Extract Fonts**: Lists all font families used on the page. Each font is displayed individually. Clicking on a font copies it to your clipboard.
- **Extract Button Styles**: Identifies different button styles used on the page. Displays a preview of each button and provides a "Copy CSS" button to copy the button's styles.
- **Logo Detection**: Attempts to fetch and display the website's logo in the extension popup for a better visual context.
